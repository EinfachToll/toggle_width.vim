# toggle_width.vim
Toggle the width of the NERDTree window

This little script is a plugin in for the [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) Vim plugin. It adds a new key (that is, w) which toggles the width of the NERDTree window between the
default width and the width of the longest file name.

Quite useful if you want to have a clear view on your files and you don't want to maximize your NERDTree.

## Installation
You need, of course, the NERDTree. Then, put this script in the nerdtree_plugin/ subdirectory in the installation of NERDTree.
